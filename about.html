  <p>As students reach high school, they begin to face more and more stress.
  These stressors can be things like thinking about the future, college, athletics, 
  and current academics. There is no way to combat all of these things, but it 
  is possible to help students feel less overwhelmed. Our website provides affirmations 
  to assist students with feeling better. Stress results in many more emotions, such
  as feeling unmotivated, aggression and frustration, and feeling powerless. Not 
  dealing with these emotions can lead to worse issues, such as mental illnesses. 
  We hope to provide a safe community for our fellow students!   </p>
